### Things to do

- [ ] add cpp, rust and their debugger support  
- [ ] leetcode and other CP stuff  
- [x] try [walker](https://github.com/abenz1267/walker) instead of wofi, check for all integrations -> nope wofi is better
- [ ] use [open-code](https://github.com/sst/opencode) along with claude code
- [x] add OBS, a local media player that can download audios from youtube or use youtube-dl for that  
- [ ] check [typix](https://github.com/loqusion/typix?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [ ] check wallpapers from [nordiac-wallpapers](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers)
- [ ] check if we can have dynamic themeing (not really important to me), check [stylix](https://nix-community.github.io/stylix/installation.html)
- [ ] check for the [unified menu system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cft6mZDzIng&t=131s) and if I want to replicate some of that
- [ ] use this for [clipboard manager](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic/tree/main/pkgs/cosmic-ext-applet-clipboard-manager), also check for other [relevant](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic/blob/main/flake.nix) cosmic apps to try
- [ ] youtube music with brave for music player as a desktop app
- [ ] replace screenshots with screen-recording to readme  
- [ ] figure out fingerprint and see if 1password can work with it
- [ ] use chromium instead of brave, and use a light theme everywhere
