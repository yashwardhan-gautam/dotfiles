### Things to do

- [ ] add cpp, rust and their debugger support  
- [ ] leetcode and other CP stuff  
- [ ] claude code, and avante.nvim support  

- [ ] use [open-code](https://github.com/sst/opencode) instead of gemini
- [ ] add startup applications - terminal, browser with last thing, mail (thunderbird?)  
- [ ] add OBS, a local media player that can download audios from youtube or use youtube-dl for that  
- [ ] check wallpapers from [nordiac-wallpapers](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers)
- [ ] check if we can have dynamic themeing (not really important to me)
- [ ] check for the [unified menu system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cft6mZDzIng&t=131s) and if I want to replicate some of that
- [ ] replace screenshots with screen-recording to readme
