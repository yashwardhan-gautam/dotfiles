### Things to do

- [ ] add cpp, rust and their debugger support  
- [ ] leetcode and other CP stuff  
- [x] try [walker](https://github.com/abenz1267/walker) instead of wofi, check for all integrations -> nope wofi is better
- [ ] use [open-code](https://github.com/sst/opencode) along with claude code
- [x] add OBS, a local media player that can download audios from youtube or use youtube-dl for that  
- [ ] check [typix](https://github.com/loqusion/typix?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [ ] check wallpapers from [nordiac-wallpapers](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers)
- [ ] check if we can have dynamic themeing (not really important to me), check [stylix](https://nix-community.github.io/stylix/installation.html)
- [ ] check for the [unified menu system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cft6mZDzIng&t=131s) and if I want to replicate some of that
- [ ] use this for [clipboard manager](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic/tree/main/pkgs/cosmic-ext-applet-clipboard-manager), also check for other [relevant](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic/blob/main/flake.nix) cosmic apps to try
- [ ] youtube music with brave for music player as a desktop app
- [ ] replace screenshots with screen-recording to readme  
- [ ] figure out fingerprint and see if 1password can work with it
- [ ] use chromium instead of brave, and use a light theme everywhere   
- [ ]  add a param flag inside flake itself, so total two flags (one for machine and the other one for WM). We can have separate for cosmic, hyprland and niri and switch between three (make another folder for it)  
- [ ] Update the files to use stylix for styling   
- [ ] use [vicinae](https://docs.vicinae.com/) instead of wofi/walker etc.
